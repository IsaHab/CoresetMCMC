This is the practical part of the master thesis Coreset Markov chain Monte Carlo. 

Python version: Python 3.12

- For illustrating the effect of the coreset size on the behaviour of CoresetMCMC run experiment_coresetsize.py
    for the regression models and experiment_gaussian_location_coresetsize.py for the Gaussian location model.
- For illustrating the effect of the subsample size on the behaviour of CoresetMCMC run experiment_subsample.py
    for the regression models and experiment_gaussian_location_subsample.py for the Gaussian location model.
- For comparing CoresetMCMC with the uniform subsampling method run experiment_unif.py for the regression models 
    and experiment_gaussian_location_unif.py for the Gaussian location model.
